-I, --include-dir <dir>            add directory to the end of the list of include search paths \n\
--dump-includes <file>             dump included symbols into specified file                    \n\
--header-class-name <name>         name of the generated header class. If this option is not    \n\
\                                   specified, then header class name is derived from the header\n\
\                                   file name. For example, class "foo_h" for header "foo.h".   \n\

\                                   <libspec> denotes a library name. Examples:                 \n\
